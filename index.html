			<h2>About Me</h2>
				
				<img id="main-pic" src="assets/images/phil_lelle.jpg" alt="A Pic of Phil">
				
				<p>Phil was born on May 24, 1982 in Ormond Beach, Florida. He has a younger brother named Travis and an older sister named Kerri. When he was 5, he moved to Orlando with his family and started elementary school at Keeth Elementary in Winter Springs, Florida. After Keeth, he proceeded to Indian Trails Middle School then to Winter Springs High School. In high school, he met his wife, Kristen.</p>

				<p>Once Phil graduated high school, he attended Seminole Community College and Valencia Community College where he obtained his AA so he could go to UCF. Phil attended UCF in 2002 - 2005 and graduated with his Bachelors in Business Management. While he was in college, he worked full time at Hughes Supply in hopes to be selected for their Mangement Traning program once he graduated. Luckily for Phil, he was selected for their program and was sent to Bradenton, Florida to learn about running a wholesale supply company. After a 1 year run in Bradenton, they relocated Phil to Lakeland, Florida to learn about the sales side of the supply business. In hopes to return to Orlando one day, Phil requested to be moved back. After they denied his relocation, Phil decided to make a career move into the financial planning industry and became a financial professional with AXA Advisors.</p>

				<p>After almost 9 years in the financial planning industry and starting his own wealth management firm, Philip left everything to start his own online business called SkyStream Technologies. SkyStream manufacutres and sells streaming media players that use the Android OS. It is an open source platform allowing end-users to completely customize their viewing experience. Along with the open source boxes is a unique program called KODI which allows the user to stream any content for free. SkyStream was started in 2012 and has consistently doubled their revenue year over year.</p>
